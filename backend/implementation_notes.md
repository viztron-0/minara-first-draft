# Minara App - Backend Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & User Authentication

- [x] Create backend and iOS project directories (`/home/ubuntu/minara_app/backend`, `/home/ubuntu/minara_app/ios`)
- [x] Install Django and necessary packages (Django REST Framework, psycopg2, SimpleJWT)
- [x] Initialize Django project (`minara_backend`)
- [x] Create core Django apps (`users`, `personal_app`, `professional_app`, `chat_app`)
- [ ] **Current Task:** Define User models and Profile models in `users/models.py`
- [ ] Configure Django `settings.py` (database, installed apps, auth settings)
- [ ] Implement User Registration API endpoint
- [ ] Implement User Login API endpoint (JWT-based)
- [ ] Implement Basic Profile creation/update API endpoints (Personal, Professional, Business)

I will now proceed to define the models for the `users` app. This will include a custom User model to allow for phone number based registration/linking for the chat feature and to better integrate personal and professional profile aspects. It will also include distinct Profile models.
